# Typo Correction

As the name suggests, this repository aims to correct typos in English.

It accounts for the placements in the characters and the alphabets in keyboard.

Note that this does not account for context, such as whether the word is subject/verb/noun.

## Common Typo Problems

1. Misplaced (Example: pritn and print)
Attribute affected: length of the word

2. Missing (Example: prnt and print)
Attribute affected: length of the word, placement of letters in keyboard

3. Mispelled (Example: abandon vs abondon)
Attribute affected: length of the word

## Example

Input: prnt
Did you mean?
1. Pant
2. Print
3. Parent
